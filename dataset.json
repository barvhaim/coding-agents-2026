The Claude Code CLI and IDE plugins essentially wrap this model. So integration points: CLI agent, IDE extension (Anthropic doesn’t have an official IDE plugin aside from CLI, but third parties do). Or directly calling the API in your own apps.",
    "supported_languages": "Supports coding in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, C#, Go, Rust, Ruby, HTML/CSS, SQL, and more – basically all major languages [oai_citation:158‡fortune.com](https://fortune.com/2026/01/29/100-percent-of-code-at-anthropic-and-openai-is-now-ai-written-boris-cherny-roon/#:~:text=Top%20engineers%20at%20Anthropic%2C%20OpenAI,the%20company%2C%20he%20says). It was trained on a large swath of GitHub, so it has broad knowledge. Anecdotally, Claude is slightly stronger in writing clean Python and pseudocode-style explanations. The extended context means it can hold an entire codebase in mind, which is a unique advantage for languages with many interdependent files (like large Java projects).",

Gemini has multiple sizes; the larger variants (Gemini Pro/Ultra) excel at complex problem solving and code generation. It’s designed to be multimodal eventually, but in code tasks it behaves similarly to GPT-4: generating code, interpreting error messages, writing tests. Early benchmarks show it performing on par or better than GPT-4 in many coding challenges. It also integrates deeply with Google’s ecosystem, enabling features like generating entire Android apps from a prompt (via Studio Bot) or assisting in Google Cloud’s tools.",
    "use_cases": "Used via **Google Bard (with code assist)** and **Gemini Code Assist** in products. Ideal for developers already in Google’s dev environment: e.g., coding in Android Studio (Studio Bot is powered by a Gemini model), using Google Cloud Shell or Cloud Workstations with the AI helper, or in VS Code/JetBrains through the Google Code Assist plugin [oai_citation:161‡developers.google.com](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/gemini-cli#:~:text=be%20set%20up%20in%20other,environments). It’s also accessible in Google’s ChatGPT-like interface (Bard) where it can produce and explain code.

The model is available on Google Cloud Vertex AI for API access (Enterprise). Third-party integration is less common outside the Google ecosystem, as Google has not released open weights. Essentially, if you’re using a Google product with AI, Gemini might be the model under the hood as of 2026. Developers can call it through Vertex AI API (requires a Google Cloud project and probably whitelisting during preview).",
    "supported_languages": "Gemini’s training includes a vast amount of code (it’s built on Google’s analyses of GitHub, etc., similar to PaLM 2 which was strong in Python/JS/Java). It supports all major programming languages.

It’s also integrated into domain-specific cases (like Google Sheets formulas or Apps Script generation via Bard). It can likely handle about as broad a range as GPT-4. One noted strength: it might generate code that aligns well with Google style guides (based on its training and reinforcement).",

The code-focused aspects were formerly “Codey” in PaLM 2; with Gemini, those are integrated. It uses Google’s TPUs for serving. One interesting aspect: Gemini can use tools (like Google search) in the context of Code Assist, which means part of its deployment includes an agent loop (though the raw model itself is just an LLM that might have been trained with some tool-use knowledge).",

For enterprise Code Assist: there’s likely a licensing cost per user (similar to Microsoft’s $30/user for 365 Copilot, Google might bundle AI into Google Workspace or Cloud offerings).

    "use_cases": "Local or private coding assistance where using closed APIs is undesirable. Developers integrate Code Llama into IDE extensions (experimental VSCode plugins exist) to get on-prem code completion and chat. It’s used in research as a baseline and by companies that require an internal model for IP reasons. Typical uses: autocompletion, generating simple scripts, or use in Jupyter notebooks to suggest code. The Python variant is particularly good for data science snippets.",
    "autonomy_level": "Low",
    "integration": "Requires running the model on suitable hardware (GPUs). Many use cases involve loading Code Llama in a library like HuggingFace Transformers and querying it for completions. It can be fine-tuned or quantized to run on smaller GPUs. There are community forks (like Code Llama in text-generation-webui, or as part of local-LLM coding bots). In summary, integration is DIY – it’s a model, not a service. Tools like AWS SageMaker JumpStart host it, and some cloud providers offer it as an endpoint.",

Python was given extra training (there’s a 34B Python model). It can output other languages too but might be less fluent in something like Rust or Go compared to Python/JS. Still, as a model it doesn’t fundamentally exclude any language – it’s about proficiency levels which are high for popular ones.",

Some users further fine-tune it (e.g., Code Llama - Instruct for better chat). It’s static (doesn’t improve unless you fine-tune) and requires provisioning appropriate compute.",
    "pricing": "Free to use. If you run it locally, cost is just your hardware/electricity. If using a cloud VM, you pay for that (no charge for the model itself). It being open source means no token fees. However, running the 34B model with good speed might require a beefy GPU (which can cost ~$1-2/hour in cloud). Smaller 7B/13B run on consumer GPUs with less cost but also less capability. Many businesses find this attractive as a one-time or fixed cost alternative to paying API usage continually.",
